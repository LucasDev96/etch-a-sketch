This is another project for The Odin Project that I'm beginning today. The goal of this project is to make something similar to an etch-a-sketch inside of a web browser. There will be a square container div, filled with and equal amount of rows and columns of equally sized square divs. The goal is to make it so when the cursor moves over a div, the color will change, sort of like you're drawing on an etch-a-sketch. Originally I'll probably only have it go to black, then will add functionality for random colors, and I'll also be making it possible to customize how many divs are available to color in. The range will probably be 10x10 to 100x100. I look forward to learning everything needed for this project.

As of today I've finished a good amount of the functionality and bugs with my etch-a-sketch website. There's still a lot visually to do as the website doesn't look very pleasing. Also there is a bug where a white line will occasionally be present at the bottom of the grid for certain grid sizes. Along with visually updating this and fixing any bugs that I find, I would also like to eventually add the ability to save any drawings people make if that ends up being possible.

I've gotten the website looking about as good as I want it to look and don't currently have any ideas for this project that I'm capable of doing. One day I want to figure out a way to make it possible to download the etch-a-sketch creation as an image file, but I've tried html2canvas and couldn't get that working after several hours of trying to make that work so I might come back to that some other day. As of right now I'm happy with the project and will move on with the rest of The Odin Project.
